    <h2>A Serious Conversation</h2>

    <p>I want to talk to you calmly and honestly.</p>

    <p>I care about you, and I feel peaceful when I talk to you. That is something very rare and valuable to me.</p>

    <p>But I also believe that for any relationship to survive, we both need strength, clarity, and maturity.</p>

    <p class="highlight">If your parents pressure you for marriage, crying alone will not protect us.</p>

    <p>We need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Emotional strength</li>
        <li>Courage to stand for our decisions</li>
        <li>Focus on studies and career</li>
        <li>Patience to wait until we are ready</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I am still building my career. I need 2–3 years to become stable before thinking about marriage.</p>

    <p>I don’t want you to feel pressure. I don’t want to rush. I just want us to grow stronger step by step.</p>

    <p>If we are serious about each other, we must think practically, not only emotionally.</p>

    <p>I respect you. I just want us to build something strong, not something rushed.</p>
